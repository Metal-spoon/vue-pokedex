# <p align=center>Vue pokedex</p>
<p align=center>A simple pokedex made with Vue and GraphQL</p>

## About
<p> This project started as an assessment when applying for a company, it used to use a backend made by said company. </br>
I wanted to share my code on my Github and decided to refactor it to use the experimental pokeAPI graphQL backend to learn a bit about using graphQL. </br>
The pokedex data is stored in the localstorage of the browser. </br>
This project is just for fun, don't expect serious work to be done on it. </br>
